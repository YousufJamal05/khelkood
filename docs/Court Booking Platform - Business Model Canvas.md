## Market Gap

First-mover advantage available in Karachi market
## 1.2 Competitive Landscape
## Direct Competitors
- BookMyGame.pk - Pakistan's indoor sports booking platform
Exists but limited adoption
Covers multiple cities including Karachi
Unknown commission structure
Opportunity: Better UX, faster onboarding, lower commissions
- Individual Facility Websites/Apps
Futsalrange.com (DHA, Wapda Town, Valencia locations)
Fragmented approach, no unified search
Opportunity: Aggregate all venues in one place
- WhatsApp Groups - Primary competitor
Free but highly inefficient
Manual confirmation delays
No payment integration
No historical tracking

Opportunity: Instant confirmation, payment security, booking history
## Indirect Competitors
Phone booking directly with facilities

Corporate/league bookings (bypassing booking systems)
## Competitive Advantages
- Technology: Flutter mobile app with real-time availability
- Pricing: Lower commission rates (8-10% vs potential 12-15% competitors)
- Focus: Laser-focused on Karachi initially vs trying to cover all Pakistan
- User Experience: Purpose-built for local payment methods (JazzCash/EasyPaisa)
- Court Owner Value: Free for first 3 months, clear ROI demonstration
## 2. Revenue Model
## 2.1 Primary Revenue Stream: Transaction Commission
## Commission Structure
Sports facility booking apps commonly charge 10% commission, with successful platforms ranging from
5% to 30%
The median commission for successful marketplaces is 10%, which is a good starting point
Our recommended structure:
PhaseCommission RateRationale
Launch (Month 1-3)0% (Free pilot)Attract first 5-10 court owners, prove value
Growth (Month 4-6)5-8%Competitive rate to maintain relationships
Scale (Month 7-12)8-10%Industry standard, sustainable long-term
Mature (Year 2+)10-12%With proven value and network effects

## Why This Works
Lower marketplace pricing can be used to disrupt market leaders
OpenTable (restaurant bookings) uses low margins due to thin provider profit margins
Court owners already have low margins on bookings
8-10% commission leaves room for court profitability
